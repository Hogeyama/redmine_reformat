h1. Qtags - bold, italic, underlined and similar inline formatting

h2. Special pandoc behavior

Parentheses and prackets within qtags should be interpreted as normal text: *(hello)* *[hello]* *{hello}*

Pandoc is fragile about dashes in strikeout text: -this should - be (?) striked-out-

h2. Special Redmine behavior

+Underlined text+
_Italic_
*Bold*
 *[[WikiLink]]*

Redmine supports _multiline
qtags_ and even allows to _
start with a newline_

h2. Prevent escaping in-word underscores

My username is joe_average or joe__average or _joe or whatever.
Friends call me joe_ or whatever.

h2. Ensuring interpreting in tables

|_. Task |_. Description |
|_this would not be identified as qtags if not spaced_| spaces should be added around table delimiters    |

h2. Collisions

* Ok to use _within item_
* But block _structure
* takes precedence_
